# MERN project - Memories

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project called "Memories." It is a web application that allows users to create and store their memories. The project is divided into front-end and back-end components, and it leverages React for the user interface, Express for the server-side, MongoDB for the database, and Node.js for the runtime environment.

To work with same project using python as backend checkout [Memories in flask](https://github.com/realsanjeev/Memories-flask-api-project).

```bash
curl icanhazip.com
```


4. Set up the back-end by installing the required dependencies:
